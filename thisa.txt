Loved you yesterday, love you still, always have, always will
I saw that, you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that, you were not perfect ,and I loved you ,even more.
Thinking of you, keeps me ,awake. Dreaming of you, keeps me, asleep. Being with you ,keeps me ,alive
There is never a time or place for true love. It happens ,accidentally ,in a heartbeat, in a single flashing throbbing moment
Love does not begin, and end the way ,we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war, love is a growing up
